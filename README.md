## TroveApp Project V1.0

### Trove - Live Lavishly

A platform, on which users can sell and rent high-end, luxurious clothes you otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford.
<br>
Imagine you have a hot date, or you’re simply meeting someone you need to impress. Buying actual brand name products would be too much of an investment for just a short amount of time. TROVE allows users to sell their own brand name products to other users for a prorated fee for however long they want.
